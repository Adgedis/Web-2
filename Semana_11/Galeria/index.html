    <figcaption>The sea is calm to-night.
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; - on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! 
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.<small>Matthew Arnold - Dover Beach</small></figcaption>

    <figcaption>All around the world, mountains rise up out of the landscape, reaching high in to the sky. These mountains have always held an irresistible attraction. They represent impossible challenges, insurmountable obstacles that dare to be summited. To overcome these beautiful peaks is to prove oneself capable of great feats of both physical and mental endurance. For some, climbing mountains can be a life-long dedication. For others, mountains can be symbolic for the day to day challenges encountered in our lives. Either way, these perilous yet majestic landforms continue to hold a position of awe and wonderment in our lives.<small>NO NAME</small></figcaption>

      I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears; 
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine.
And he knew that it was mine,

And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole; 
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

    <figcaption>Little lady sings determined,
shallow stockings ignite poison;
a deferential shell candid blue,
sway hips, jump some onto shore;
an innocent heart trapped in black,
ghost in an eggshell mind squeals;
metempsychosis drafts angels hearts
she remorsefully antagonises her fate,
whilst sleeping under a willow, tame;
knife in the water catches sunlight,
spray purple-pink waves on a lake:
resolute libido reawakens debate. <small>Liba - Little Lady</small></figcaption>

    <figcaption>A man saw a ball of gold in the sky; 
He climbed for it, 
And eventually he achieved it -- 
It was clay. 

Now this is the strange part: 
When the man went to the earth 
And looked again, 
Lo, there was the ball of gold. 
Now this is the strange part: 
It was a ball of gold. 
Aye, by the heavens, it was a ball of gold.

    <figcaption>To me, I see
Further than he, but he,
Sees his own seas;
Soft, innocent fleece

Circled under a veil
Of creativity, sets sail,
Wondered aimlessly, but well, 
An answerless well, you fell<small>Laman - Vanity Tidal Waves</small></figcaption>
